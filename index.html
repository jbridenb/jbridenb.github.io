I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I really enjoyed writing this program, but had trouble with blah blah blah.

<!-- WARNING-Please do not copy/paste any of this code.  You may utilize the concepts here 
but I don't want to see a bunch of assignments with the exact layout, class names etc.  
Type every line of code yourself!  Change the names, be creative, make the assignment your own!

TRICK:  select all text in this file, 'Ctrl-A', then use 'Alt-Shift-f' to format your document with proper indents etc.
