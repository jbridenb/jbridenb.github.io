I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I mostly enjoyed doing this project. I struggled a little with
the table till i found the correct patter. The only other things that i struggled with were the
different style things that just felt very clunky.

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>I like Mountain Biking. I started when i was around 12 and haven't put it down since. I recently decided to
          buy
          a motorcycle this last year and have been just about addicted to riding that as I am to riding my Mountain
          Bike
          In addition another hobby of mine is reading.</p>
        <p>You probably noticed that I changed the title for the section
          about books to be series instead. That's because it's too hard for me to decide on individual books. When
          looking at a story i prefer to look at it as a whole.</p>
        <p>I am currently working as a data analyst. I spend most of my days coding in SQL and developing reports for
          the
          company I work for. I really enjoy this but still want to move into a Full Stack developer postion.</p>
