      <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
      <p>I like Mountain Biking. I started when i was around 12 and haven't put it down since. I recently decided to buy a motorcycle this last year and have been just about addicted to riding that as I am to riding my Mountain Bike</p>
      <p>In addition another hobby of mine is reading. You probably noticed that I changed the title for the section about books to be series instead. That's because it's too hard for me to decide on individual books. When looking at a story i prefer to look at it as a whole.</p>
      <p>I currently work as a data analyst. I spend most of my days coding in SQL and developing reports for the company I work for. I really enjoy this but still want to move into a Full Stack developer postion.</p>
